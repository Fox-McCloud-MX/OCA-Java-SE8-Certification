Incorrect Answer.

10. F. a += 2 expands to a = a + 2. A String concatenated with any other type gives
a String. Lines 14, 15, and 16 all append to a, giving a result of "2cfalse". The if
statement on line 18 returns false because the values of the two String objects are the
same using object equality. The if statement on line 17 returns false because the two
String objects are not the same in memory. One comes directly from the string pool
and the other comes from building using String operations.

11. E. Line 6 adds 1 to total because substring() includes the starting index but not
the ending index. Line 7 adds 0 to total. Line 8 is a problem: Java does not allow the
indexes to be specified in reverse order and the code throws a StringIndexOutOf-
BoundsException.

17. F. The ArrayList class defines a method called size().

18. A, C, D, E. An array is not able to change size and can have multiple dimensions. Both
an array and ArrayList are ordered and have indexes. Neither is immutable. The elements
can change in value.

25. D. After sorting, hex contains [30, 3A, 8, FF]. Remember that numbers sort before
letters and strings sort alphabetically. This makes 30 come before 8. A binary search
correctly finds 8 at index 2 and 3A at index 1. It cannot find 4F but notices it should
be at index 2. The rule when an item isn’t found is to negate that index and subtract 1.
Therefore, we get –2–1, which is –3.

26. A, B, D. Lines 5 and 7 use autoboxing to convert an int to an Integer. Line 6 does
not because valueOf() returns an Integer. Line 8 does not because null is not an int.
The code does not compile. However, when the for loop tries to unbox null into an
int, it fails and throws a NullPointerException.

28. D, F. Options A and B are incorrect because LocalDate does not have a public constructor.
Option C is incorrect because months start counting with 1 rather than 0.
Option E is incorrect because it uses the old pre–Java 8 way of counting months, again
beginning with 0. Options D and F are both correct ways of specifying the desired
date.
