Incorrect Answer.

1. Option E is a tricky one, because prior to Java 8 all interface methods
would be assumed to be abstract. Since Java 8 now includes default and static
methods and they are never abstract, you cannot assume the abstract modifier will be
implicitly applied to all methods by the compiler.

20. A. The code compiles and runs without issue, so options C, D, and E are incorrect.
The trick here is that the method fly() is marked as private in the parent class Bird,
which means it may only be hidden, not overridden. With hidden methods, the specific
method used depends on where it is referenced. Since it is referenced within the Bird
class, the method declared on line 2 was used, and option A is correct. Alternatively,
if the method was referenced within the Pelican class, or if the method in the parent
class was marked as protected and overridden in the subclass, then the method on line
9 would have been used.
