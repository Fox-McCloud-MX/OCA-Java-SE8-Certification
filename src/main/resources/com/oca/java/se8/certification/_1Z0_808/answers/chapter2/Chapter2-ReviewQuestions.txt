Incorrect Answer.

2. A, B, D. The value x + y is automatically promoted to int, so int and data types that
can be promoted automatically from int will work. Options A, B, D are such data
types. Option C will not work because boolean is not a numeric data type. Options E
and F will not work without an explicit cast to a smaller data type.

4. B, C, D, F. The code will not compile as is, so option A is not correct. The value 2 * x
is automatically promoted to long and cannot be automatically stored in y, which is
in an int value. Options B, C, and D solve this problem by reducing the long value to
int. Option E does not solve the problem and actually makes it worse by attempting
to place the value in a smaller data type. Option F solves the problem by increasing the
data type of the assignment so that long is allowed.

8. B. This example is tricky because of the second assignment operator embedded in line
5. The expression (z=false) assigns the value false to z and returns false for the
entire expression. Since y does not equal 10, the left-hand side returns true; therefore,
the exclusive or (^) of the entire expression assigned to x is true. The output reflects
these assignments, with no change to y, so option B is the only correct answer. The
code compiles and runs without issue, so option F is not correct.

14. C. The code compiles successfully, so option F is incorrect. On line 5, the pre-increment
operator is used, so c is incremented to 4 and the new value is returned to the
expression. The value of result is computed by adding 4 to the original value of 8,
resulting in a new value of 12, which is output on line 6. Therefore, option C is the
correct answer.

18. A. The expression on line 5 is true when row * col is an even number. On the first
iteration, row = 1 and col = 1, so the expression on line 6 is false, the continue is
skipped, and count is incremented to 1. On the second iteration, row = 1 and
col = 2, so the expression on line 6 is true and the continue ends the outer loop with
count still at 1. On the third iteration, row = 2 and col = 1, so the expression on line
6 is true and the continue ends the outer loop with count still at 1. On the fourth
iteration, row = 3 and col = 1, so the expression on line 6 is false, the continue is
skipped, and count is incremented to 2. Finally, on the fifth and final iteration, row
= 3 and col = 2, so the expression on line 6 is true and the continue ends the outer
loop with count still at 2. The result of 2 is displayed, so the answer is option B.
