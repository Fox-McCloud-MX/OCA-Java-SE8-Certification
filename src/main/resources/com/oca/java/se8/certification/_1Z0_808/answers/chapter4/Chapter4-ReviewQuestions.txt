Incorrect Answer.

6. D. Option D is correct. This is the common implementation for encapsulation by setting
all fields to be private and all methods to be public. Option A is incorrect because
protected access allows everything that package private access allows and additionally
allows subclasses access. Option B is incorrect because the class is public. This means
that other classes can see the class. However, they cannot call any of the methods or
read any of the fields. It is essentially a useless class. Option C is incorrect because
package private access applies to the whole package. Option E is incorrect because Java
has no such capability.

10. B. Rope runs line 3, setting LENGTH to 5, then immediately after runs the static initializer,
which sets it to 10. Line 5 calls the static method normally and prints swing.
Line 6 also calls the static method. Java allows calling a static method through an
instance variable. Line 7 uses the static import on line 2 to reference LENGTH.

15. E. The argument on line 17 is a short. It can be promoted to an int, so print() on
line 5 is invoked. The argument on line 18 is a boolean. It can be autoboxed to a boolean,
so print() on line 11 is invoked. The argument on line 19 is a double. It can
be autoboxed to a double, so print() on line 11 is invoked. Therefore, the output is
intObjectObject and the correct answer is option E.

18. C, G. Since the main() method is in the same class, it can call private methods in the
class. this() may only be called as the first line of a constructor. this.variableName
can be called from any instance method to refer to an instance variable. It cannot be
called from a static method because there is no instance of the class to refer to. Option
F is tricky. The default constructor is only written by the compiler if no user-defined
constructors were provided. this() can only be called from a constructor in the same
class. Since there can be no user-defined constructors in the class if a default constructor
was created, it is impossible for option F to be true.

19. A, G. Options B and C don’t compile because the constructor name must match the
classname. Since Java is case sensitive, these don’t match. Options D, E, and F all compile
and provide one user-defined constructor. Since a constructor is coded, a default
constructor isn’t supplied. Option G defines a method, but not a constructor. Option A
does not define a constructor, either. Since no constructor is coded, a default constructor
is provided for options A and G.
