# Interface.
##### Definition Rules:

1. Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.
2. An interface is not required to have any methods.
3. An interface may not be marked as final.
4. All top-level interfaces are assumed to have public or default access, and they must include the abstract modifier in their definition. Therefore, marking an interface as private, protected, or final will trigger a compiler error, since this is incompatible with these assumptions.
5. All nondefault methods in an interface are assumed to have the modifiers abstract and public in their definition. Therefore, marking a method as private, protected, or final will trigger compiler errors as these are incompatible with the abstract and public keywords.

> The fourth rule doesnâ€™t apply to inner interfaces, although inner classes and interfaces are not in scope for the OCA exam.
